# Randomness and Control Statements

*Susanna Lange*

Whether modeling a real-world example, like rolling dice, tossing a coin, or randomly selecting a subset of a population for a survey, the process of selecting a choice from a list of options at random is very useful. This chapter will cover the basics of random selection, including how to implement a random choice in Python.

Additionally, we introduce programming control statements, which allow us to select or iterate statements and expressions.

We'll ultilize these ideas to *simulate* experiments, that is to imitate real-world examples using code.
